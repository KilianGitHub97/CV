                    Hi there! I feel pleased that you want to learn a little bit more about me. I’m a student at the University of Zurich (Switzerland), where I’m currently enrolled in the master’s program in Data Science. I have interests in statistics, machine learning & deep learning, computational cognitive modelling, methodology and study design. Making sense of complex data seems fascinating to me and accompanies me in both my academic training and my leisure time!
                  </p>
                  <p class="main_text">
                  I started my academic journey at the University of Basel (Switzerland), from where I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Since the step from a Bachelor's in Psychology to a Master's in Data Science may seem non-trivial, I would like to elaborate a bit on this. I caught up with psychology during my days at high school, which led to the decision to make it my subject of study for my Bachelor’s degree. Since the discipline of psychology, contrary to what is often assumed, has very little to do with Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung, but is an empirical science, I was very soon confronted with statistics & research methodology. I immediately fell in love with the approach of reasoning with data. Another ground-breaking experience for me was a full-year seminar (4 ECTS each semester), in which we were allowed to conduct our own empirical study. In the seminar, we created our own research design, collected survey data (with Qualtrix) and analyzed it ourselves (with R). Since I already knew how to code from my time at high school, I quickly found my way with statistical software.<br><br>
                  In the summer of 2020, I was able to further develop my experience with statistical software: I was able to get an internship at the department of Economic Psychology, where I was supervised by PD. Dr. Jana Jarecki, a research scientist who specialized in Computational Cognitive Modelling. During the Internship I was able to conduct a parameter recovery study for a cognitive model called Generalized Context Model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1986; Model that aims to predict human behaviour in categorization tasks). Parameter recovery is basically the computational-modelling-equivalent to model-evaluation in machine learning. I was able to collect about 300 working hours of coding in R and could deepen my knowledge in (uni- and multivariate) statistics.<br><br>
                  The internship led to the decision to specialize in the areas of data analysis and statistical programming. But at the same time, I realized that I had some deficits in mathematics. I worked on these deficits in the last two semesters of my Bachelor by attending math courses at the Faculty of Economics (Mathematics 1 - Calculus; Mathematics 2 - Linear Algebra & Mathematical Statistics). Further, I attended courses dealing with data analysis (relevant courses are listed below).<br><br>
                  I was privileged to conduct my bachelor's thesis on the topic of my main interest in psychology, Computational Cognitive Modelling. PD. Dr. Jana Jarecki, my supervisor from my last internship encouraged me to apply for a thesis supervised by PD. Dr. Thorsten Pachur from the Max Planck Institute. The collaboration with him was very instructive. My bachelor thesis is called "Mathematical Models to Understand Sequential Choice Data derived from the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)" and can be visited <a class="internallink" href="../RMD/Bachelor_Thesis_Kilian_Sennrich.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>
                  During my time as a bachelor student, I studied some topics of Data Science on my own and analysed data sets from Kaggle from time to time. Unfortunately, I couldn't spend as much time on this as I would have liked. That's why I decided to do a Master in Data Science. Now I can deal with the topics during my studies and get credit points for my work. <br>
