                  <p class="abstract">
                    Hi there! I feel pleased you want to learn a little bit more about me. I’m a student at the University of Zurich (Switzerland), where I’m currently enrolled in the master’s program in Computer Science with major Data Science. I have interests in statistics, machine learning & deep learning, computational cognitive modelling, methodology and study design. Making sense of complex data seems fascinating to me and accompanies me in both my academic training and my leisure time!
                  </p>
                  <p class="main_text">
                    I started my academic journey at the University of Basel (Switzerland), from where I hold a <b>bachelor’s degree in Psychology</b>. Since the discipline of psychology, contrary to what is often assumed, has little to do with Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung, but is an empirical science, I was very soon confronted with statistics & research methodology. Working on various studies, I learned how to gather data of high quality and got my hands dirty with statistical software. <br><br>
                    In the summer of 2020, I did an internship in Computational Cognitive Modeling at the department of Economic Psychology. I conducted a Parameter Recovery for a cognitive model called Generalized Context Model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1986; the model aims to predict human behavior in categorization tasks). Parameter recovery is the computational modelling equivalent to model evaluation in machine learning. During the internship, I collected around 300 working hours of R coding and could deepen my knowledge in (uni- and multivariate) statistics.<br><br>
                    During my bachelor’s I took a lot of extracurricular courses in mathematics (e.g., Calculus, Lin. Alg., Mathematical Statistics, Multivariate Statistics And Machine Learning). I list below some courses I have taken that are relevant to Data Science. <br><br>
                    I was privileged to conduct my bachelor's thesis in collaboration with the <b>Max Plank Institute</b>. My bachelor thesis is called "Mathematical Models to Understand Sequential Choice Data derived from the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)" and can be visited <a class="internallink" href="../RMD/Bachelor_Thesis_Kilian_Sennrich.pdf">here</a>. <br><br>
                    After my bachelor's degree, I worked for half a year in the pharmaceutical industry at <b>F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG</b> in Basel. This internship allowed me to combine my passion for cognitive neuroscience and data science. As a member of the Department for Neuroscience and Rare Diseases - Biomarkers and Translational Technologies, I was involved in research on novel biomarkers for dementia.<br><br>
                    To get more involved in the field of data analysis, in 2021, I decided to start a <b>master’s in computer science</b> at the University of Zurich (Switzerland). With my prior education in other fields, I was accepted into this master's program under the condition to make up relevant courses from the bachelor's degree in computer science (acceptance under additional requirements).  For example, I had to attend courses in data structures and algorithms, software engineering and theoretical computer science. For my major I have chosen Data Science. Thus, I can devote myself to the subject with appropriate mathematical rigor and fidelity to detail.<br><br>
                    During my master studies I worked as a working student in the Quant Lab - Systematic Equities at the institutional Asset Manager <b>Bantleon Bank AG / Bantleon AG</b> in Zurich. I worked closely with portfolio managers and the Head of Department, helped automate data operation processes, and created a platform for fund analytics and fund comparison. I worked primarily with R.<br><br>
                    During the 2022 semester break, I did a 10 week summer internship at <b>Zürcher Kantonalbank</b> in Zurich. Zürcher Kantonalbank is the fourth largest bank in Switzerland. I was affiliated with the Investment Banking Division in the department “Trading - Equities and Structured Products” and worked closely with the Head of Department. I helped validating the company's option pricing models using empirical data and helped identify potential for gaining market share in the Swiss market for structured products. I worked with SQL and Python (Pandas, Numpy, Dask and more).<br>
