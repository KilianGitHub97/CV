                  Hi there! I feel pleased that you want to learn a little bit more about me. I’m currently a student at university of Basel Switzerland and looking forward to completing my bachelor’s degree next year. Subject of study is psychology. I have a particular interest in cognitive modelling, information systems in psychology, methodology, data science and various algorithms of machine learning. Making sense of complex data seems fascinating to me and accompanies me in both my academic training and my leisure time!
                  </p>
                  <p class="main_text">
                  I finished secondary school with core subjects Informatics and Communication Systems. At this time I acquired the basics of programming. I mainly focused on web development, but got more and more involved with non-technical subjects as well. I specifically caught up with psychology, which led to the decision to make this my subject of study in tertiary level of education. My goal was to maybe become a therapist one day. <br>
                  Just after a semester into my bachelor’s degree, I realized that psychotherapy is not my future dream job anymore. There are a couple of good reasons why not but naming them would really lead off the path here. The following semesters were packed with courses that aim to give insight into psychological research apart from clinical psychology. Many of the courses caught my interest.<br>
                  With seminars aimed at producing evidence, I came in touch with data. I found it fascinating to mess around with methodological questions, collect data and find the right statistical measurement to back up previously made assumptions. I dug out my programming skills again and got involved with statistical software. More and more I learnt about data science and the possibilities & limitations of ML in psychology. <br>
                  To peak my bachelors degree, I got an internship at the department of Economic Psychology, where I conducted a parameter recovery study for a cognitive model called Generalized Context Model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1986; Model that aims to predict human behaviour in categorization tasks). I was able to collect about 300 working hours of coding in R and could deepen my knowledge in statistics. I was able to work very independent and received valuable advice from my supervisor Ph.D. Jana Jarecki. <br>
